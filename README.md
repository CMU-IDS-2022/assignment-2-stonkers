### Deliverables

- [ ] An interactive data science or machine learning application using Streamlit.
- [ ] The URL at the top of this readme needs to point to your Streamlit application online. The application should also list the names of the team members. 
- [ ] A write-up that describes the goals of your application, justifies design decisions, and gives an overview of your development process. Use the `writeup.md` file in this repository. You may add more sections to the document than the template has right now.
